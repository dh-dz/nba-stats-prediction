# nba-stats-prediction
The goal is to use historical NBA game statistics data (from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games, games.csv and teams.csv) and corresponding sports betting odds data (before each game, from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christophertreasure/nba-odds-data, oddsData.csv) to build predictive models on the game results: which team wins, score spread, score sum, etc. and design betting strategies accordingly.
